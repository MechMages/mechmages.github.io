            <p>
                The Mech Mages team members volunteered at STEM night at <a href="https://rsouth.rsdmo.org/">Rockwood South Middle school</a> 
                on the 25th of April. Our team enjoyed interacting with the younger students and teaching

            <h2>Superbowl of Destruction at the Arch Reactor - 2024</h2>
            <p>The Mech Mages attend an annual electronics recycling event at a  local “Hackerspace” where we recycled nearly $300 
                dollars worth of equipment! We were excited to interact with the memebrs of the <a href="https://archreactor.org/">Arch Reactor</a> who were incredibly generous 
                and kind to our team</p>
