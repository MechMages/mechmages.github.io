            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The Mech Mages #24385, a second-year robotics team, consists of a diverse group of 
                primarily high school upperclassmen. Under the Saint Louis Students Robotics Association, 
                our mission is to recruit and mentor community youth, equipping them with valuable STEM skills 
                such as computer programming, 3D design, and manufacturing. Additionally, we emphasize the 
                development of soft skills like communication and business acumen.

                As active participants in the FIRST Tech Challenge, we proudly uphold FIRST's core values, 
                including gracious professionalism and community service. Our team is dedicated to contributing 
                to our community through various outreach projects, fostering a spirit of collaboration and innovation.
